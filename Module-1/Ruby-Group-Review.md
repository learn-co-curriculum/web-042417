##Group Exercise
We're going to split up into groups and spend 30 minutes researching, exploring, and discussing some of the fundamental facets of Ruby.  Then each group will have 6 minutes to teach their topic to the rest of the class and demonstrate these concepts using irb or by running a Ruby program in the terminal. **EVERYONE WILL PRESENT**

###Group 1 - Arrays!
Tell us all about how to use arrays in Ruby.  You should make sure that you are prepared to explain and demonstrate:

* how to create arrays in Ruby - p1
* how to add items to an array - p1
* how to remove items from an array - p2
* how to iterate over an array using each - p2
* at least four other methods available to arrays--[find,select,collect,grep] - p3/4

###Group 2 - Hashes!
Tell us all about Ruby hashes!  You should make sure that you are prepared to explain and demonstrate:

* what a hash is - p1
* how to create a hash using the hash rocket syntax and the newer syntax that was added in Ruby v1.9 - p1
* how to create,read, add, and remove items from a hash - p2
* give me 3 useful built in hash methods - p3/4
* what symbols are and why we use them with hashes - p4

###Group 3 - Blocs and methods!
Tell us all about writing custom methods in Ruby.  You should be prepared to explain and demonstrate:

* the syntax for writing a method in Ruby and invoking - p1
* parameter vs argument - p1
* proc explained and creation - p2
* passing blocs as arguments - p3
* splat * operator - p4

###Group 4 - Loops!
Tell us all about how to write loops in Ruby.  You should be prepared to explain and demonstrate:

* how to write an each loop , define x Times - p1
* how a while loop works and how to write one - p2
* how a until loop works and how to write one - p3
* how a for in loop works and how to write one - p4

###Group 5 - Conditionals!
Tell us all about how to write conditionals in Ruby.  You should be prepared to explain and demonstrate:

* creating if elseif else - p1
* unless and ternary  - p2
* switch statement - p3
* explain "&&", "||", "!=", "==", "===" - p4
